#### SIEM: Security Information and Event Management

Smart SIEM is a system for private enterprises for log management and cybercrime detection.

- Beats software collects logs.
- Logstash software filters these logs.
- Elastic Search Database stores logs.
- Machine Learning Module contains models trained on Intrusion Datasets that perform detection in real-time logs data.
- Intrusion Datasets cover all network features.
- Data is pre-processed.
- DT ID3 and MLP models perform detection.
- Node JS backend Module pre-processes real-time data according to models.
- Also extracts important stats and info for SOC security.
- React JS front-end displays all outcomes in the dashboard.
- Datasets and Results are mentioned in Details.pdf
